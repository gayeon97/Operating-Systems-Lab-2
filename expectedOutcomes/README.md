The outputs differ depending on the type of the algorithm used.

There are 4 algorithms used:
* First Come First Serve (FCFS)
* Round Robin (RR)
* Last Come First Serve (LCFS)
* Highest Penalty Ratio Next (HPRN)



There are 7 inputs: input-1 to input-7.\
Each of these inputs will have four different outputs for each of the algorithms.\
There are 3 ways to display an output:
* Regular version that displays the following:
  * The original list
  * The sorted list by the arrival time
  * The name of the algorithm used
  * Each process information
  * Summary Data
* Verbose version
  * same as regular version but
  * displays additional information on the state and remaining burst for each process
* Show-random version
  * same as verbose version but
  * displays additional information on the random number chosen for calculating the CPU burst when choosing a ready process to run
